// Package model exposes the supported parser-independent semantic data model
// for Skel contracts. It is a public facade over skelc's internal model
// implementation.
//
// Values in this package are produced by the root skelc package's Parse
// function and are the supported input for custom code generators. Names in
// SkelName fields are fully qualified, while Name fields contain the
// declaration's local name. Hash fields are deterministic compatibility hashes
// calculated by skelc. The implementation remains internal so only names
// deliberately re-exported by this package form part of the public API.
//
// Model values retain the resolved references and compiler state needed by
// custom generators. For a normalized, versioned compatibility representation
// derived from this model, use go.yorun.ai/skelc/schema.
